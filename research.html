      <p>
        The Action and Basic Research section showcases ongoing and completed research projects aimed at improving the educational system. These projects are designed to explore new methods, validate existing strategies, and provide data-driven insights into education reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus is on both **Action Research** (which aims to solve real-world issues) and **Basic Research** (which contributes to the foundational understanding of educational theories and practices). Through these efforts, we continue to improve the learning environment and educational outcomes for both teachers and students.
